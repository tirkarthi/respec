# respec [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tirkarthi/respec.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tirkarthi/respec)

A collection of specs for clojure core functions

## Motivation

This is a collection specs I wrote as a learning exercise to learn spec and also to learn more about clojure.core functions. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/778tc2//dok9akv/) Reddit comment is the core inspiration for the repo. [Expound](https://github.com/bhb/expound) is also a cool library for error messages

## Installation

I haven't included it in Clojars since I don't know if there are better efforts to spec clojure.core functions to provide more friendly error messages.

* git clone https://github.com/tirkarthi/respec
* cd respec
* lein do pom, jar, install

# Stability warning

This is purely a learning exercise as a beginner and also to experiment with better error messages for core functions with spec. It's not production ready or stable. Please use it at your own risk. There are [efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/778tc2/is_clojure_19_improving_error_messages/dolil1v/) undertaken by the core team with regards to efforts in this.
