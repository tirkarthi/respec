## Contributions

PR and criticisms are welcome to improve the library.

* Fork the repo.
* Write a spec.
* write a test.
* Make a PR.

## TODO

* Currently all the specs are present in a single file and this can cause merge conflicts for specs and tests. But this will require which functions to go in which file. Feel free to suggest any methods to improve this.
